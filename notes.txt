Twitter usernames (and hence mentions) can only contain letters, numbers and '_' --when trying to change twitter name


When attempting to tweet #http://google.com, the hastag isn't rendered as a "topic"/"hashtag"--when trying to tweet and then using twitter's api to get a tweets entities. (yes I cheated).
	- Same applies for mentions
